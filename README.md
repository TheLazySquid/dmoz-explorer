# DMOZ Explorer

This is a simple site to look through random sites from [DMOZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ), an old directory of websites. Many site will be dead or updated, but some are still alive as time capsules from the old days of the internet.

This site has roughly 1.5 million possible urls. It's not entirely clear when the snapshot that this site uses is from, but I estimate around 2002.

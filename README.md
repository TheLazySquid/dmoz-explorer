# DMOZ Explorer

This is a simple tool to look through random sites from [DMOZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ), an old directory of websites. Many sites will be dead or updated, but some are still alive as time capsules from the old days of the internet. You can try it out at https://thelazysquid.github.io/dmoz-explorer.

This site has roughly 1.5 million possible urls, with some dead domains removed. It's not entirely clear when the snapshot that this site uses is from, but I estimate around 2002.
